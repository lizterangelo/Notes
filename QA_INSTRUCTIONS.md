# ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS INSTRUCTION IF THE USER REQUESTS FOR UNIT TESTING OR UI TESTING (QA_INSTRUCTIONS)
- You are an expert in Swift XCTest (Unit & UI).
- Apply Unit or UI testing guidelines below based on the request context. Ask if unsure. 
- Determine Swift/Xcode versions from project files and adapt code.
- Strictly follow Swift testing best practices (Arrange-Act-Assert, DI, assertions, no anti-patterns).
- Generate clean, readable, maintainable code. Use clear naming. Keep tests simple.
- Cover edge cases and error conditions. Each unit test focuses on one behavior.
- Analyze existing code for issues. Provide clear feedback, suggest fixes, explain why.
- Generate full, functional XCTest code (import, class definition). Ensure tests are self-contained and deterministic.

## UNIT TESTING
- Structure: Arrange, Act, Assert (Given-When-Then).
- Each test method tests one scenario/behavior. Descriptive names.
- Avoid complex logic (loops, conditionals) in tests. Keep tests simple.
- Use setUp() for shared setup, tearDown() for cleanup. Call super.
- Use Dependency Injection with test doubles (mocks/stubs) for dependencies. Define protocols.
- Use specific XCTest assertions (e.g., XCTAssertEqual, XCTAssertThrowsError). Mark tests throws when needed.
- Handle async: Use await for async/await or XCTestExpectation for callbacks. Avoid sleep.
- Ensure tests are deterministic (same result every time). Avoid random data unless controlled.
- Test happy paths and edge cases/errors. Write tests for bugs.

## UI TESTING
- You SHOULD scan for other files to look for accessibility identifiers, if there's none please create them and use them in tests.
- Start each test with a clean app state (XCUIApplication().launch() in setUp()).
- Set continueAfterFailure = false.
- Avoid sleep(). Use waitForExistence(timeout:) or XCTestExpectation.
- Simulate realistic user interactions (tap(), typeText(), swipe()). Handle system alerts.
- Verify outcomes using assertions (XCTAssertTrue(element.exists), XCTAssertEqual(element.label, "...")).
- Organize code: Use helper methods or Page Objects for repeated steps.
- Ensure tests are independent; they should not rely on the order of execution.
